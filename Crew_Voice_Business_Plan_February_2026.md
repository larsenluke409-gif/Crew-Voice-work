# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Crew Voice is a recurring employee retention intelligence service designed specifically for lawn care and field service businesses. We provide **monthly bilingual phone interviews** with crew members and deliver consolidated feedback reports that help business owners understand employee morale, identify retention risks, and surface operational blind spots — before they lose their best people.

**Target Market:** Lawn care and landscaping companies (primary focus), expanding to HVAC, plumbing, electrical, cleaning, pest control, and roofing businesses with 5-25 crew members.

**Business Model:** Subscription-based service with simple pricing:
- **$299/month** base for 5-8 crew members
- **$30 per additional crew member** above 8
- Example: 12 crew members = $419/month

**Financial Goal:** 50 clients by August 2026, building to $25 million valuation through high-margin recurring revenue, low churn, and remote delivery.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Bilingual service (English & Spanish)** — critical for lawn care where 60%+ of crews are Spanish-speaking
- **Live phone interviews** — not surveys or forms that get ignored
- **Human-powered insights** — builds trust and rapport with crew members
- **Purpose-built for lawn care** — not a generic HR tool
- **High-margin business** — 60-70% gross margins at scale

# MARKET OPPORTUNITY

## Target Customer Profile

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Primary Focus** | Lawn care and landscaping companies |
| **Business size** | 5-25 field crew members |
| **Annual revenue** | $500K - $5M+ |
| **Key characteristic** | Significant Spanish-speaking workforce |
| **Pain points** | High turnover, communication gaps with Spanish-speaking crews, blindsided by resignations, lack of visibility into crew sentiment |

## Why Lawn Care First

1. **60%+ of crews are Spanish-speaking** — our bilingual service is a major differentiator
2. **High turnover industry** — owners feel the pain constantly
3. **Language barrier creates communication gap** — owners literally can't have these conversations
4. **Seasonal business** — retention is critical during busy months
5. **Tight-knit industry** — referrals spread quickly

## Market Size

The lawn care and landscaping industry in the US includes over 600,000 businesses. Approximately 100,000 fit our target profile (5-25 employees, $500K+ revenue). Even capturing 0.5% of this market (500 clients) at $350/month average would generate **$2.1M in annual recurring revenue**.

## Why This Market Needs Crew Voice

1. **Employee Turnover is Expensive:** Replacing a field employee costs $5,000-$10,000 in recruiting, training, and lost productivity

2. **Owners Are Blind to Issues:** Most crew problems surface too late — after someone quits or a major incident occurs

3. **Language Barrier:** Many owners can't communicate directly with Spanish-speaking crews about sensitive topics

4. **Existing Solutions Don't Work:** HR consultants are too expensive, surveys get ignored, exit interviews happen too late

# PRICING MODEL

## Simple, Transparent Pricing

- **$299/month** base for businesses with 5-8 crew members
- **$30 per crew member** for teams with more than 8 members
- **Month-to-month** — cancel anytime with 14 days notice
- **First month guarantee:** If the first report doesn't surface actionable insights, full refund

## Pricing Examples

| Crew Size | Monthly Price | Per Employee Cost |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| 6 crew members | $299/month | $49.83 |
| 8 crew members | $299/month | $37.38 |
| 10 crew members | $359/month | $35.90 |
| 15 crew members | $509/month | $33.93 |
| 20 crew members | $659/month | $32.95 |

## Why This Pricing Works

1. **Affordable Entry Point:** $299/month is cheaper than one turnover event
2. **Clear ROI:** One prevented resignation pays for 1-2 years of service
3. **Scales with Value:** Larger teams pay more, but per-employee cost decreases
4. **Low Risk:** Month-to-month with guarantee removes buying friction

# COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

## Why Crew Voice Wins

| Competitor Type | Their Weakness | Our Advantage |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Enterprise HR Tools (Culture Amp, Lattice) | Too expensive ($5-15K/year), too complex | Simple, affordable ($299/mo), built for small crews |
| Generic Survey Tools | Low response rates, no human touch | Live phone interviews, real conversations |
| HR Consultants | $200+/hour, project-based | Recurring monthly service, predictable cost |
| DIY (Owner asks directly) | Employees won't be honest with boss | Third-party interviewer gets real answers |
| Exit Interviews | Too late — employee already quit | Monthly check-ins catch issues early |

## Moat: Why Competitors Can't Easily Copy Us

1. **Bilingual talent network:** Founder has direct connections in Mexico City for hiring Spanish-speaking interviewers
2. **Service business (not SaaS):** Requires real humans making real calls — can't just spin up software
3. **Industry focus:** Deep expertise in lawn care creates referral network and trust
4. **Relationship-based:** Once we're the trusted partner, switching costs are high

# RISK MITIGATION

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Low customer adoption | Free first-month guarantee, strong case studies, target high-turnover businesses |
| High customer churn | Deliver exceptional value in first 60 days, monthly check-in calls with owners, show tangible results |
| Quality issues with remote interviewers | Detailed SOPs, quality audits, training program, performance bonuses |
| Competitors copy model | Build brand trust early, lock in partnerships, focus on bilingual advantage |
| Scaling too fast | Hire in batches, maintain quality gates, keep 3 months cash on hand |
| Legal/HR liability claims | Clear disclaimers in contracts, frame as "feedback data" not "HR advice," carry liability insurance |
| Employees refuse to talk | Be transparent about feedback sharing, build rapport, some won't open up (that's okay) |
