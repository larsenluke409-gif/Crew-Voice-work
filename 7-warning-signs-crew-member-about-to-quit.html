    <article>
      <p>You walk onto the job site Monday morning and your best crew leader hands you his notice. No warning. No second chance. He's already got another gig lined up.</p>

      <p>Sound familiar? If you run a lawn care or landscaping business, you've probably lived this nightmare more than once. And every time it happens, it costs you <strong>$5,000 to $10,000</strong> in recruiting, training, and lost productivity.</p>

      <p>The truth is, crew members almost never quit out of nowhere. There are always warning signs. The problem? Most business owners are too busy running jobs to notice them.</p>

      <p>Here are the 7 warning signs that one of your best people is thinking about leaving — and what you can do about each one.</p>

      <div class="warning-sign">
        <h3>1. They Stop Volunteering for Extra Work</h3>
        <p>Your best guy used to be the first one to say "I'll stay late" or "I'll take the Saturday job." Now he's clocking out right at 5:00 and turning down overtime.</p>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> He's mentally checked out. The job has gone from something he takes pride in to just a paycheck. Or he's saving energy for interviews at other companies.</p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Have a casual conversation. "Hey, I noticed you've been heading out early — everything okay at home?" Don't accuse. Just show you notice and care.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-sign">
        <h3>2. They're on Their Phone More Than Usual</h3>
        <p>Everyone checks their phone, but if someone who was normally focused is now constantly texting or stepping away for calls during the workday, pay attention.</p>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> They could be coordinating with a recruiter, responding to job listings, or talking to a competitor who's trying to poach them.</p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Don't confront them about the phone. Instead, check in on their overall satisfaction. "How are things going? Anything I can do to make the job better?"</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-sign">
        <h3>3. Their Attitude Has Changed</h3>
        <p>Someone who used to be positive and upbeat is now quiet, short-tempered, or just going through the motions. They might be picking fights with coworkers or complaining more.</p>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> Something is bothering them — could be pay, workload, respect, or problems with a supervisor. When people get frustrated enough, they start acting out before they leave.</p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> This is the most important sign to act on quickly. A frustrated employee who feels heard will often stay. One who feels ignored will definitely leave.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-sign">
        <h3>4. They've Mentioned Pay or Benefits at Other Companies</h3>
        <p>"My buddy at XYZ Landscaping makes $3 more an hour." If a crew member is bringing up what other companies pay, they're telling you they've been comparing options.</p>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> They're testing whether you'll match or beat a competing offer. This is actually a good sign — it means they'd rather stay if the money was right.</p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Take it seriously. Run the numbers. Can you offer a raise, a bonus structure, or non-cash benefits (flexible schedule, paid time off, gas card)? Losing them and hiring a replacement costs way more than a $2/hour raise.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-sign">
        <h3>5. They're Not Engaging with the Team</h3>
        <p>They used to eat lunch with the crew, crack jokes on the truck ride, and help the new guys learn the ropes. Now they're keeping to themselves.</p>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> They're emotionally distancing themselves from the team because they're planning to leave. It's easier to quit when you're not close to your coworkers.</p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Pull them aside privately. "You seem a little different lately. I value you on this team and I want to make sure everything's good." Sometimes just being seen is enough.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-sign">
        <h3>6. They Start Caring Less About Quality</h3>
        <p>Your most detail-oriented crew member is suddenly leaving sloppy edges, missing spots, or rushing through jobs they used to take pride in.</p>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> When someone decides they're leaving, they stop caring about their reputation at your company. Quality drops because motivation is gone.</p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Address the quality issue, but don't just criticize — dig deeper. "This isn't like you. What's going on?" Connect the quality conversation to the bigger picture.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-sign">
        <h3>7. They Ask About Their Final Check or PTO Balance</h3>
        <p>If someone asks "What happens with my unused PTO if I leave?" or "When would my last paycheck come?" — they're not asking hypothetically.</p>
        <p><strong>What it means:</strong> They're doing the math on their exit. This is usually the final stage before they give notice (or just stop showing up).</p>
        <p><strong>What to do:</strong> You're in emergency mode. Have a direct conversation: "It sounds like you might be thinking about leaving. What would it take for you to stay?" Be honest and be willing to negotiate.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Biggest Problem: You Can't See These Signs If You're Not Looking</h2>

      <p>Here's the real challenge for lawn care and landscaping owners: <strong>you're not on the job site all day.</strong> You're meeting with clients, writing estimates, managing schedules, and putting out fires. By the time you notice something's off, it's often too late.</p>

      <p>And here's what makes it even harder: <strong>if over half your crew speaks Spanish and you don't, you're missing the conversations where these warning signs actually surface.</strong> Your crew is talking about their frustrations, their plans, and their concerns — just not in a language you understand.</p>

      <div class="key-takeaway">
        <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>Every one of these warning signs is fixable — <strong>if you catch it early enough.</strong> The key is having a system that gives you regular, honest feedback from your crew so you can act before it's too late.</p>
        <p>That's exactly what <a href="../index.html">Crew Voice</a> does. We talk to your crew every month — in English and Spanish — and tell you who's happy, who's frustrated, and who's thinking about leaving. So you can fix problems while there's still time.</p>
